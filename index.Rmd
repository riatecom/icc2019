## Clochard 0., 2003

???

The first map of dead migrants at the borders of the European Union was created in 2003 by the French geographer Olivier Clochard. 

The principle of this map is simple. It combines quantitative information: the number of dead and missing migrants represented by the surface of the circles. And qualitative information: the cause of death represented by color. 

This was the first time this data had been mapped.

In 2006, Olivier Clochard's work was reworked by cartographer Philippe Rekacewicz to be published in a French newspaper: Le Monde diplomatique.

Then, this map, always made according to the same principles, was updated many times by the cartographers of the Migreurop network

## What about data?

<img src="img/data.png"/>

???

When the first map was produced, there were no official data. The authors had to rely on militant data, the only data available, collected by the Dutch NGO, United against Racism, which has been collecting press reports since 1993 listing migrants who have disappeared in Europe and its neighbourhood.

The second source of data comes from the Fortress Europe blog of the Italian journalist Gabriele Del Grande, which also lists the deaths at the borders. This work began in 1997 and ended in February 2016.

In 2014, a collective of European journalists from 15 different countries called "the migrant's file" was created. Their work consisted mainly of searching the two databases mentioned above, checking each event and cross-referencing data to avoid duplication. In the end, there are not so many duplicates, and it can be seen that the number of deaths has so far been largely underestimated. This data journalism work was awarded. The database ends in mid-2016.

## What about data?

???

Today, the main source of data comes from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which launched its death and missing migrants platform in 2014. The data is "official" and daily updated.

The most deadly year is 2016.

The most deadly month is April 2015 (in the middle of what was called the migration crisis).
